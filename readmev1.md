For my phase 1 project I am creating a simple page for basketball fans.

The basic concept is on loading it will show you a list of all current NBA teams. When you click on a teams cards it will act as a button and provide additional information on the back of the card.

It also gives you the option to fill the form on top and create your own custom team to add to the NBA's roster.

It will utilize all the principles learned thus far. It will fetch the data from a db.json to create the team cards displayed on the page. It will use event listeners to activate different funcitons using buttons such as creating a team and also clicking on the team to flip the card and see additional information.
